# Sea-Dominion

- Sea Dominion is a python-based battleships game which allows the player to battle against the computer in a classical battleships style. The player and the computer are both provided with a board on which the ships are randomly placed. The player will get 20 attempts to sink the computer's ships by guessing the position of the ships. The game is based both on luck and strategy, as the player has to guess the position of the computer's ships at first, while later being able to strategically pin down their position.

## How to Play
### Gameplay
- When first opening the game the player will be presented with a menu, which explains the rules. The player will also be asked to enter a username, which has to be at least 4 characters long.
After entering the username, the player will be greeted with the applied username and a line will declare: Commence battle!
- On the Gameboard, the player can see the ships, marked as "â‚¬". The purpose f the game is to find and sink all the computer's ships before the computer does the same with the player's ships. Having 20 attempts, the player must guess the position of the computer's ships by entering numbers representing horizontal and verical rows on the Gameboard.
### Game over
- If the player manages to sink all the computer's ships the game will declare: "You won! All the computers ships have been sunk." If it's the other way around and the computer sinks the player's ships, the game will instead declare "You lost! All Your ships have been sunk." The player will then have the option to either quit the game or start a new game.
- Sometimes the game will result in a draw when all 20 attempts have been used. The game will then declare "Both players have ships remaining." The player will then have the option to either quit the game or start a new game.
